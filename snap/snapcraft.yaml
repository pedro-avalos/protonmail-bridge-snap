  NOTE: This is a wrapper of the official package, but it is not verified,
  affiliated with, or supported by Proton AG.

  You need to have a keychain in order to run the Proton Mail Bridge. To allow
  access to the keychain, you have to manually connect the
  [`password-manager-service`](https://snapcraft.io/docs/password-manager-service-interface)
  plug.

  ```bash
  sudo snap connect protonmail-bridge:password-manager-service
  ```

  Proton Mail Bridge is a desktop application that runs in the background,
  encrypting and decrypting messages as they enter and leave your computer.
